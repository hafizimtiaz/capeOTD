Decentralized Differentially Private Orthogonal Tensor Decomposition (capeOTD)
=====================================
This repository includes MATLAB implementation of the capeOTD algorithm that can achieve the same utility as the pooled-data scenario in an honest-but-curious model. Please see the original paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8509100 

* common_functions_OTD -- MATLAB functions needed for the simulations
* datasets -- synthetic and real datasets used for the simulations 
* plots -- codes for generating plots from saved results
* MOG/STM vs delta -- codes for variation of performance with $$\delta$$ in the Mixture of Gaussian or Single Topic Model setup
* MOG/STM vs epsilon -- codes for variation of performance with $$\epsilon$$ in the Mixture of Gaussian or Single Topic Model setup
* MOG/STM vs samples -- codes for variation of performance with number of samples in the Mixture of Gaussian or Single Topic Model setup
